I know, rather, I feel that we have come to a certain point. An emotion has rolled over me that tells me one thing; we are growing apart. It’s happened before, and so many other times. I guess it is what people do; they find each other, and then for some reason, they lose each other along the way again in an infinite butterfly effect of serendipitous moments and strange attractors.
I see you before my eyes as the perfect individual you have become these last few months. I see it so clearly in my mind’s eye. It is so vivid that it can only be real. This has been the first time, in a while, that I feel, or rather, sense it. There is a strange taste in the air. I feel a premonition. It flashes and signals that something has changed, or that it is about to. It’s a funny feeling when you know something will change; you don’t know it for sure, but something tells you that it has actually already changed.
We grew close in the short time we’ve spent together; best friends and all the bells and whistles. I always hate it when it changes the fear of being alone stifles me. But that’s exactly what I have learnt this time, from you. We do not own each other!
In this sense, we cannot force one another to act in a defined way. If we get upset once we realise the other has changed or if we feel that they are acting outside their character. We lose. Because then we know we thought we owned that person.
